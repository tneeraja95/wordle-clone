# Wordle Clone

I developed a fully functional Wordle clone in React, where users have six chances to guess a randomly chosen five-letter word. The game includes features like score storage and a virtual keyboard for letter input, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. Additionally, I focused on making the game responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on any screen size. The technologies used for this project include HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript.
